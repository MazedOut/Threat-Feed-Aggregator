# Threat-Feed-Aggregator
A low-code threat intelligence aggregator that automatically fetches Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, URLs, domains, and file hashes from public threat feeds like URLhaus and FeodoTracker. The tool normalizes and deduplicates the collected data, storing it in a Google Sheet with source information and timestamps.
